# Contribution Rules

To maintain the quality and organization of the project, please follow these rules:

1. **Avoid Duplicates**: Before adding a new concept, check existing files to ensure the topic isnâ€™t already covered.

2. **File Naming**: Use lowercase letters and hyphens for file names (e.g., `quick-sort.md`).

3. **Format**: Each markdown file should follow this structure:
   # Concept Title

   ## Description
   Brief explanation of the concept.

   ## Examples
   Include code snippets or examples if applicable.

   ## References
   Any references or links to further reading.

4. **Adding Content**:
   - You can contribute by enhancing the content of existing markdown files.
   - You may also create new files for concepts that are not already covered.

5. **Links**:
   - You can only include links in files that you create yourself, such as links to references or further reading.
   - Do not add links in existing files; they should remain focused on the content.
   - You can include links to your social media profiles in the contributor information section at the bottom of each markdown file.

6. **Contributor Information**: At the bottom of each markdown file, include your name and links to your profiles:
   Contributor: Your Name  
   [GitHub](https://github.com/your-github) | [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/your-linkedin) | [X](https://x.com/your-x)
